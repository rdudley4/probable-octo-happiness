Oh, I think we should just stay friends. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Yep, I remember.

If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. </p><p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Bender, you risked your life to save me! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! No, I'm Santa Claus! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p> <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Oh God, what have I done? Say what? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
